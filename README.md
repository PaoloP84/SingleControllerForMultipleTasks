# SingleControllerForMultipleTasks

This repository contains the files to replicate the experiments reported in the paper submitted to Algorithms journal:

"Discovering a Single Neural Network Controller for Multiple Tasks with Evolutionary Algorithms"

In order to run the experiments, users must download the FARSA simulator from the official page:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/farsa/files/

Because FARSA requires Qt4 libraries that have been deprecated in Ubuntu 20.04, users can refer to:
